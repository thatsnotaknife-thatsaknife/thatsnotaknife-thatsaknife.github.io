        <pre>
      This was initially supposed to be a server for an Eve Online management app..
       But as I got further into the installation and realized I had no idea what I was
      doing with Django and Nginx and OAuth tokens, I decided to dig deeper..
       And as I learned from my mistakes and scratched even further into the surface of
      programming and computer science I looked into NAND2Tetris.. But after
       designing an ALU in /not/ Java with /not/ HDL I decided to stop scratching the
      surface and get a pickaxe. 
       Now, armed with a Raspberry Pi, a knockoff Arduino, and a library of books on
      computer architecture, logic design and the C/C++/C# parliament of programming paradigms,
       (Yes, I know they're very different languages, but they did all come from C),
      I'm embarking on an adventure to learn how to make video games.

        <p>Stick around and watch the show. Should be fun one way or the other. Current project is a C# Console Adventure/RPG</p>
